Hello World!

Igor here. I enjoy short walks on the beach and the midday heat. I like to write and learn but so far only know some Python and a bit of Java. I'm looking to use github to help me create mobile apps for my android device and who knows what else.. I'm open to go wherever this new adventure takes me.

Cheers
